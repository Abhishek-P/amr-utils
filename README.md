# amr-utils
A python package of common operations for AMRs


I wrote amr-utils to store operations that I often need when doing research with AMRs. Use it to load multiple AMRs from a text file, iterate through nodes or named entities, and output them into a useful format.

# HTML
Amr-utils allows you to read AMRs from a text file and output them as html. You can look in `style.css` for an example of styling. 


# Latex
Amr-utils allows you to read AMRs from a text file and output them as latex diagrams, such as the following.
